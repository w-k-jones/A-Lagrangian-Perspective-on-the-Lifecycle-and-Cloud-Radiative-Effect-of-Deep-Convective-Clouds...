  abstract = {2020 has been a key year in the MeteoSat Third Generation (MTG), with the integration and tests of the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) proto-flight model(PFM). The FCI is the imaging instrument of the MeteoSat Third Generation mission, whose first satellite MTG-I1 will be launched in the second half of 2022. Its large spectral coverage, its fast and flexible scanning, associated with demanding radiometric and optical performances will allow a step forward in Europe weather nowcasting. In 2018, three complementary development models were successfully integrated and tested. The Engineering Model validated the optical and radiometric performances of the detection chain. The Structural and Thermal Model qualified the robustness of the design against launch and in-orbit environments and validated the consistency with the thermal and microvibration mathematical model predictions. The Avionic Test Bench with the software which reached a very good level of maturity, validated the control, command and data handling of the instrument. The completion of these developments enabled to successfully hold the instrument Critical Design Review (CDR) end 2018. In 2019, the two main components of the instrument, namely the telescope assembly and the detection control electronics assembly (DCEA) successfully passed the acceptance tests and have been delivered. The article will present first an overview of the instrument design and the main outcomes of the development models. Then, it will discuss the up-to-date status of the FCI PFM development. Finally, it will introduce the overall planning for the four FCI models to be delivered to the MTG-I satellite series. This work has been performed under an ESA contract to Thales Alenia Space-France.},

Whilst the cores of these deep convective clouds have a significant shortwave (SW) cooling effect, they dissipate quickly. Conversely, the thin cirrus that flow from these cores can persist for days after the core has dissipated, reaching hundreds of kilometers in extent. These thin cirrus have a potential for large warming in the tropics. Understanding the evolution of these clouds and how they change in response to anthropogenic emissions is therefore important to understand past and future climate change.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This work uses a novel approach to investigate the evolution of tropical convective clouds by introducing the concept of \&lsquo;Time Since Convection\&rsquo; (TSC). This is used to build a composite picture of the lifecycle of deep convection, from anvil cirrus to thin detrained cirrus. Cloud properties are a strong function of time since convection, showing decreases in the optical thickness, cloud top height, and cloud fraction over time.

However, once the convective core had dissipated after 6\&ndash;12 hours, the sign of the CRE flipped, and there was a sustained net warming CRE beyond 120 hours from the convective event. Changes are present in the cloud properties long after the main convective activities have dissipated, signalling the need to continue further analysis at longer time scales than previously studied.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This paper revisits this question using CloudSat data and focuses on interconnecting various environmental parameters and cloud properties, which have often been examined in a piecemeal way in the past. Our analysis shows that if convection is treated as a process by which potential energy (convective available potential energy) is converted to kinetic energy (vertical velocity), then the conversion is more efficient over land than ocean. A key factor that affects this conversion efficiency is the lifting condensation level (LCL). Higher LCLs over land give rise to broader dry boundary layer thermals that transition to wider deep convective cores. Wider cores, in turn, are better protected from the dilution by entrainment, thus leading to stronger updrafts. This study highlights the importance of the dry stage of convection.},

Tropical cirrus are affected by processes spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, from ice microphysics on cloud scales to mesoscale convective organization and planetary wave dynamics. This complexity makes tropical cirrus clouds notoriously difficult to model and has left many important questions stubbornly unanswered. At the same time, their multi-scale nature makes them well positioned to benefit from the rise of global, high-resolution simulations of Earth's atmosphere and a growing abundance of remotely sensed and in situ observations. Rapid progress requires coordinated efforts to take advantage of these modern computational and observational abilities.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In this Opinion, we review recent progress in cirrus studies, highlight important questions that remain unanswered, and discuss promising paths forward. We find that significant progress has been made in understanding the life cycle of convectively generated ``anvil" cirrus and how their macrophysical properties respond to large-scale controls. On the other hand, much work remains to be done to understand how small-scale anvil processes and the climatological anvil radiative effect may respond to global warming. Thin, in situ-formed cirrus are now known to be closely tied to the thermal structure and humidity of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), but uncertainty at the microphysical scale remains a significant barrier to understanding how these clouds regulate the TTL moisture and temperature budgets, as well as the mixing ratio of water vapor entering the stratosphere. Model representation of ice-nucleating particles, water vapor supersaturation, and ice depositional growth continue to pose great challenges to cirrus modeling. We believe that major advances in the understanding of tropical cirrus can be made through a combination of cross-tool synthesis and cross-scale studies conducted by cross-disciplinary research teams.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Representing about 30 \% of the Earth's total cloud cover, upper tropospheric clouds play a crucial role in the climate system by modulating the Earth's energy budget and heat transport. When originating from convection, they often form organized systems. The high spectral resolution of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) allows reliable cirrus identification, both from day and nighttime observations. Tropical upper tropospheric cloud systems have been analyzed by using a spatial composite technique on the retrieved cloud pressure of AIRS data. Cloud emissivity is used to distinguish convective core, cirrus and thin cirrus anvil within these systems. A comparison with simultaneous precipitation data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer \textendash{} Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) shows that, for tropical upper tropospheric clouds, a cloud emissivity close to 1 is strongly linked to a high rain rate, leading to a proxy to identify convective cores. Combining AIRS cloud data with this cloud system approach, using physical variables, provides a new opportunity to relate the properties of the anvils, including also the thinner cirrus, to the convective cores. It also distinguishes convective cloud systems from isolated cirrus systems. Deep convective cloud systems, covering 15 \% of the tropics, are further distinguished into single-core and multi-core systems. Though AIRS samples the tropics only twice per day, the evolution of longer-living convective systems can be still statistically captured, and we were able to select relatively mature single-core convective systems by using the fraction of convective core area within the cloud systems as a proxy for maturity. For these systems, we have demonstrated that the physical properties of the anvils are related to convective depth, indicated by the minimum retrieved cloud temperature within the convective core. Our analyses show that the size of the systems does in general increase with convective depth, though for similar convective depth oceanic convective cloud systems are slightly larger than continental ones, in agreement with other observations. In addition, our data reveal for the first time that the fraction of thin cirrus over the total anvil area increases with the convective depth similarly for oceanic and continental convective systems. This has implications for the radiative feedbacks of anvils on convection which will be more closely studied in the future.},

Here we test this so-called ``zero-buoyancy'' theory for CAPE by modulating the saturation deficit of cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium in two ways: changing the sea surface temperature (SST) and changing the environmental relative humidity (RH). For earthlike and warmer SSTs, undilute parcel buoyancy in the lower troposphere is insensitive to increasing SST because of a countervailing CC scaling that balances the increase in the saturation deficit; however, buoyancy increases dramatically with SST in the upper troposphere. Conversely, in the RH experiment, undilute buoyancy throughout the troposphere increases monotonically with decreasing RH. We show that the zero-buoyancy theory successfully predicts these contrasting behaviors, building confidence that it describes the fundamental physics of CAPE and its response to warming.},

The complex coupling between clouds and the large-scale circulation in the tropics contributes to this uncertainty. To address this problem, the coupling between clouds and circulation in the latest generation of climate models is compared to observations. Significant biases are identified in the models. The implications of these biases are assessed by combining observations of the present day with future changes predicted by models to calculate observationally constrained feedbacks. For the dynamic cloud feedback (i.e., due to changes in circulation), the observationally constrained values are consistently larger than the model-only values. This is due to models failing to capture a nonlinear minimum in cloud brightness for weakly descending regimes. Consequently, while the models consistently predict that these regimes increase in frequency in association with a weakening tropical circulation, they underestimate the positive cloud feedback associated with this increase.},

  abstract = {Tropical deep convective clouds are important drivers of large-scale atmospheric circulation representing the main vertical transport pathway through the depth of the troposphere for heat, momentum, water, and chemical species. The strength and depth of this transport are impacted by the convective updraft size and intensity that are driven by buoyancy, dynamical forcing, and mixing of environmental air, that is, entrainment. In this study, we identify tropical deep convective systems with well-defined forward anvils using Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) ground-based profiling radars, at three ARM fixed sites in the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP; i.e., Manus, Nauru, and Darwin) and three ARM Mobile Facility deployments in Niamey, Niger; Gan Island, Maldives; and Manacapuru, Brazil. We use the difference between the level of neutral buoyancy (LNB) and the level of maximum detrainment (LMD) as a proxy for the effective bulk convective entrainment ({$\epsilon$}proxy). The LNB, the theoretical height that a parcel raised above the level of free convection would reach with no mixing, is calculated based on preconvection radiosonde measurements using parcel theory. The LMD is the height of the maximum reflectivity observed in forward anvil clouds by profiling radars. Deep convective systems over the TWP show higher LNBs that extend to 16.3 km on average and larger {$\epsilon$}proxy (median value of LNB minus LMD up to 6.5 km) compared to their continental counterparts in the Amazon and West Africa. Oceanic conditions show larger convective available potential energy (CAPE) coupled with higher moisture at low levels, which favors larger {$\epsilon$}proxy. In contrast, continental cases initiate and develop, under high convective inhibition, steeper environmental lapse rate, and high wind shear conditions, which show smaller offset between LNB and LMD. Deep convective cases that promote significant cold pools at the surface experience less {$\epsilon$}proxy. Using a Random Forest regression algorithm, CAPE is associated with the highest feature importance score for predicting convective {$\epsilon$}proxy, followed by low-level relative humidity. For continental cases, the low-level wind shear also indicates higher importance.},

The goal of the current study is to provide a more complete characterization of LNB, deep convective outflow, and convective core, and the relationship among them, as well as the dependence on environmental parameters and convective system size. A proxy is introduced to estimate convective entrainment, namely, the difference between the LNB (based on the ambient sounding) and the actual outflow height. The principal findings are as follows: (1) Deep convection over the Warm Pool has larger entrainment rates and smaller convective cores than the counterpart over the two tropical land regions (Africa and Amazonia), lending observational support to a long-standing assumption in convection models concerning the negative relationship between the two parameters. (2) The differences in internal vertical structure of convection between the two tropical land regions and the Warm Pool suggest that deep convection over the two tropical land regions contains more intense cores. (3) Deep convective outflow occurs at a higher level when the midtroposphere is more humid and the convective system size is smaller. The convective system size dependence is postulated to be related to convective lifecycle, highlighting the importance of cloud life stage information in interpretation of snapshot measurements by satellite. Finally, implications of the study to global modeling are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Atmospheric radiative cooling is a fundamental aspect of Earth's greenhouse effect, and is intrinsically connected to atmospheric motions. At the same time, basic aspects of longwave radiative cooling, such as its characteristic value of 2 K day-1, its sharp decline (or ``kink'') in the upper troposphere, and the large values of CO2 cooling in the stratosphere, are difficult to understand intuitively or estimate with pencil and paper. Here we pursue such understanding by building simple spectral (rather than gray) models for clear-sky radiative cooling. We construct these models by combining the cooling-to-space approximation with simplified greenhouse gas spectroscopy and analytical expressions for optical depth, and we validate these simple models with line-by-line calculations. We find that cooling rates can be expressed as a product of the Planck function, a vertical emissivity gradient, and a characteristic spectral width derived from our simplified spectroscopy. This expression allows for a pencil-and-paper estimate of the 2 K day-1 tropospheric cooling rate, as well as an explanation of enhanced CO2 cooling rates in the stratosphere. We also link the upper-tropospheric kink in radiative cooling to the distribution of H2O absorption coefficients, and from this derive an analytical expression for the kink temperature Tkink {$\approx$} 220 K. A further, ancillary result is that gray models fail to reproduce basic features of atmospheric radiative cooling.},

High clouds thicker than 2 km experience longwave heating at cloud base, longwave cooling at cloud top, and shortwave heating at cloud top. The shortwave and longwave effects have similar magnitudes during midday, but only the longwave effect is present at night, so high clouds experience a substantial diurnal cycle of radiative heating. Furthermore, anvil clouds are more persistent or laterally expansive during daytime. This cannot be explained by variations of convective intensity or geographic patterns of convection, suggesting that shortwave heating causes anvil clouds to persist longer or spread over a larger area. It is then investigated if shortwave heating modifies anvil development by altering turbulence in the cloud. According to one theory, radiative heating drives turbulent overturning within anvil clouds that can be sufficiently vigorous to cause ice nucleation in the updrafts, thereby extending the cloud lifetime. High-frequency air motion and ice-crystal number concentration are shown to be inversely related near cloud top, however. This suggests that turbulence depletes or disperses ice crystals at a faster rate than it nucleates them, so another mechanism must cause the diurnal variation of anvil clouds. It is hypothesized that radiative heating affects anvil development primarily by inducing a mesoscale circulation that offsets gravitational settling of cloud particles.},

  abstract = {We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6\textendash 3.9 K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3\textendash 4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5\textendash 95\% ranges are 2.3\textendash 4.7 K, bounded by 2.0\textendash 5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

Simulations robustly project an increase in cloud height, which is supported by some observational evidence. However, how much of this increasing trend is due to climate warming and how much is due to multiyear natural variability still remains unclear because of the brevity of existing observational records. Here we estimate when the signal will become detectable at 95\% confidence by existing radar technology. We use output from a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 Community Earth System Model version 1 simulation in a Monte Carlo analysis to determine (1) what is the first year at which changes in the altitude of high cloud can be confidently estimated if we continue to fly W-band cloud radar, (2) what radar sensitivity is required to detect those changes, and (3) at what latitude will we first detect these changes? In Community Earth System Model version 1 a cloud radar record would be able to confidently detect upward shifts in cloud height over 20\textendash 60\textdegree N before 2030 for a radar with a sensitivity of -15 dBZ and stable calibration errors of {$\pm$}0.25 dBZ. Furthermore, vertical resolution could be degraded to 1.6 km with little effect on detection year. Results are more sensitive to the magnitude of calibration errors than to the minimum detectable echo. Our earlier midlatitude detection contrasts with a previous lidar-based analysis, which may be due to radar detecting different parts of the clouds and our use of simulations that account for changing geographical patterns of forced warming through time.},

The strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation decreases as the climate warms in all IPCC AR4 models, in a manner consistent with the thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and Soden. The weakening occurs preferentially in the zonally asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley) component of the tropical circulation and is shown to induce substantial changes to the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the overall circulation weakens by decreasing the frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the frequency of weak updrafts, although the robustness of this behavior across all models cannot be confirmed because of the lack of data. As the climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean resemble ``El Ni\~no\textendash like'' conditions; however, the mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El Ni\~no and are reproduced in both mixed layer and full ocean dynamics coupled climate models. The character of the Indian Ocean response to global warming resembles that of Indian Ocean dipole mode events.

These responses include the decrease in convective mass fluxes, the increase in horizontal moisture transport, the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and its temporal variance, and the decrease in the horizontal sensible heat transport in the extratropics. A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor.},

By analyzing radiative\textendash convective equilibrium simulations, we show that this behavior is rooted in basic energetic and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere: As the climate warms, the clouds rise and remain at nearly the same temperature, but find themselves in a more stable atmosphere; this enhanced stability reduces the convective outflow in the upper troposphere and decreases the anvil cloud fraction. By warming the troposphere and increasing the upper-tropospheric stability, the clustering of deep convection also reduces the convective outflow and the anvil cloud fraction. When clouds are radiatively active, this robust coupling between temperature, high clouds, and circulation exerts a positive feedback on convective aggregation and favors the maintenance of strongly aggregated atmospheric states at high temperatures. This stability iris mechanism likely contributes to the narrowing of rainy areas as the climate warms. Whether or not it influences climate sensitivity requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {Automated methods for the detection and tracking of deep convective clouds in geostationary satellite imagery have a vital role in both the forecasting of severe storms and research into their behaviour. Studying the interactions and feedbacks between multiple deep convective clouds (DCC), however, poses a challenge for existing algorithms due to the necessary compromise between false detection and missed detection errors. We utilise an optical flow method to determine the motion of deep convective clouds in GOES-16 ABI imagery in order to construct a semi-Lagrangian framework for the motion of the cloud field, independently of the detection and tracking of cloud objects. The semi-Lagrangian framework allows severe storms to be simultaneously detected and tracked in both spatial and temporal dimensions. For the purpose of this framework we have developed a novel Lagrangian convolution method and a number of novel implementations of morphological image operations that account for the motion of observed objects. These novel methods allow the accurate extension of computer vision techniques to the temporal domain for moving objects such as DCCs. By combining this framework with existing methods for detecting DCCs (including detection of growing cores through cloud top cooling and detection of anvil clouds using brightness temperature), we show that the novel framework enables reductions in errors due to both false and missed detections compared to any of the individual methods, reducing the need to compromise when compared with existing frameworks. The novel framework enables the continuous tracking of anvil clouds associated with detected deep convection after convective activity has stopped, enabling the study of the entire life cycle of DCCs and their associated anvils. Furthermore, we expect this framework to be applicable to a wide range of cases including the detection and tracking of low-level clouds and other atmospheric phenomena. In addition, this framework may be used to combine observations from multiple sources, including satellite observations, weather radar and reanalysis model data.},

The introduction of digital imagery to this process, which has been carried out since 1978, has made possible a partial automation of the MCC documentation procedure and subsequently expanded opportunities for research. In conjunction with these improvements, the definition of an MCC has been slightly modified from that proposed by Maddox in 1980. The warmer threshold area measurement ({$\leqslant-$}32\textdegree C) of Maddox's original criteria has been dropped from consideration because its measurement was too subjective, and also was determined to be unnecessary. In 1985, 59 MCCs were identified; this total is approximately 20 to 40 more than in any year since 1978, when these annual summaries began. The monthly distribution and seasonal progression of MCCs in 1985 are similar to those of prior years. The enhanced MCC activity in June 1985 is associated with a persistent favorable quasi-geostrophic forcing during that period. Significant MCC research conducted in 1985 included a prototype large-scale field program (0.-K. PRE-STORM) in May and June dedicated solely to the investigation of middle-latitude mesoscale convective systems.},

The MCS life cycle is documented using a tracking algorithm. A composite approach is then implemented to document the evolution of radiative properties at each life stage at the scale of the tropical belt, in continental and oceanic regions and in specific regions. Independently of the considered region, the composites share similarities with a unique maximum in albedo and a unique minimum in OLR, values of which differ depending on the environment as well as the amplitude of both parameters over the life cycle. The unique precessing orbit of the Megha-Tropiques satellite allows a consideration of the albedo as a function of the local time of observation showing that the magnitude of the albedo signal is mainly controlled by the solar zenithal angle. Sensitivity tests make possible the quantification of the impact of an error in radiative properties showing that even small errors lead to substantial increment on the instantaneous cloud radiative effect. All together, these elements point toward the subtle balance between life cycle, cloud radiative properties, and phasing within the diurnal cycle to build the atmospheric radiative budget in oceanic or continental regions.},

Taking advantage of recent tracking techniques, this study investigates the evolution of macrophysical, microphysical, and radiative properties over the MCS life cycle by merging geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data. These observations are performed in three major convective areas: continental West Africa, the adjacent Atlantic Ocean, and the open Indian Ocean. MCS properties are also investigated according to internal subregions (convective, stratiform, and nonprecipitating anvil). Continental MCSs show a specific life cycle, with more intense convection at the beginning. Larger and denser hydrometeors are thus found at higher altitudes, as well as up to the cirriform subregion. Oceanic MCSs have more constant reflectivity values, suggesting a less intense convective updraft, but more persistent intensity. A layer of small crystals is found in all subregions, but with a depth that varies according to the MCS subregion and life cycle. Radiative properties are also examined. It appears that the evolution of large and dense hydrometeors tends to control the evolution of the cloud albedo and the outgoing longwave radiation. The impact of dense hydrometeors, detrained from the convective towers, is also seen in the radiative heating profiles, in particular in the shortwave domain. A dipole of cooling near the cloud top and heating near the cloud base is found in the longwave; this cooling intensifies near the end of the life cycle.},

  abstract = {Satellite infrared data and in situ surface measurements from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA CORE) are used to examine the diurnal variations of deep convection in two distinct large-scale flow regimes over the western Pacific warm pool. Large-scale atmospheric dynamic and radiative processes strongly affect the life-cycle of deep convective systems in the tropics. the observed diurnal variation of tropical cloud systems suggests that diurnal heating of the tropical atmosphere and ocean surfaces provides favoured conditions in the afternoon for the formation of cloud systems and, as the cloud systems grow and decay with time, the diurnal cycle of cloudiness reflects the life-cycle (initiation, growth, and dissipation) of cloud systems. During the convectively suppressed phases of the intra-seasonal oscillation (ISO), the cloud systems are spatially small and their lifetimes are generally short ({$<$} 3 h). They form, reach maximum size, and die preferentially in the afternoon, at the time of day when the ocean surface and overlying atmospheric surface layer are warmest from solar heating. During the convectively active phases of the ISO, the cold cloud coverage is dominated by spatially large, long-lived cloud systems. They tend to form in the afternoon (1400-1900 lst) and reach a maximum areal extent of very cold cloud tops ({$<$} 208 K) before dawn (0000-0600 lst). As part of their life-cycle, the subsequent decay of these large systems extends into the next day; the satellite-observed maximum cloud coverage is dominated by successively warmer cloud tops, from 208-235 K in the early afternoon ({$\sim$} 1400 lst) to 235-260 K in the early evening ({$\sim$} 1800 lst). Meanwhile the frequency of small cloud systems exhibits two peaks-one in the afternoon and the other in the predawn hours. the latter is evidently triggered by outflows from the large convective systems. The life-cycle of the large, long-lasting convective systems introduces horizontal variability into the pattern of observed cold cloud tops during the active phases of the ISO. Because the life-cycle of large convective systems can take up to a day, they leave the boundary layer filled with air of lower moist-static energy and a cloud canopy that partially shades the ocean surface from the sunlight the following day. So the day after a major large convective system, the surface conditions do not favour another round of convection; therefore, convection occurs in neighbouring regions unaffected by the previous convective systems. We call this spatially selective behaviour of the large systems diurnal dancing. the boundary-layer recovery phase leads to a tendency for the large systems to occur every other day at a given location. This 2-day periodicity appears to phase-lock with westward-propagating equatorial inertio-gravity waves of similar frequency. the combination of the diurnal surface-cloudradiation interaction and equatorial inertio-gravity waves may explain the observed westward-propagating 2-day disturbances in cold cloud tops over the warm pool.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the tracking of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) from geostationary satellite infrared data in the tropical regions. In the past, several automatic tracking algorithms have been elaborated to tackle this problem. However, these techniques suffer from limitations in describing convection at the ``true'' scale and in depicting coherent MCS life cycles (split and merge artifacts). To overcome these issues, a new algorithm called Tracking Of Organized Convection Algorithm through a 3-D segmentatioN has been developed and is presented in this paper. This method operates in a time sequence of infrared images to identify and track MCS and is based on an iterative process of 3-D segmentation of the volume of infrared images. The objective of the new tracking algorithm is to associate the convective core of an MCS to its anvil cloud in the spatiotemporal domain. The technique is applied on various case studies over West Africa, Bay of Bengal, and South America. The efficiency of the new algorithm is established from an analysis of the case studies and via a statistical analysis showing that the cold cloud shield defined by a 235-K threshold in the spatiotemporal domain is decomposed into realistic MCSs. In comparison with an overlap-based tracking algorithm, the analysis reveals that MCSs are detected earlier in life cycle and later in their dissipation stages. Moreover, MCSs identified are not anymore affected by split and merge events along their life cycles, allowing a better characterization of their morphological parameters along their life cycles.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the tropical African and neighboring Atlantic region there is a strong contrast in the properties of deep convection between land and ocean. Here, satellite radar observations are used to produce a composite picture of the life cycle of convection in these two regions. Estimates of the broadband thermal flux from the geostationary Meteosat-8 satellite are used to identify and track organized convective systems over their life cycle. The evolution of the system size and vertical extent are used to define five life cycle stages (warm and cold developing, mature, cold and warm dissipating), providing the basis for the composite analysis of the system evolution. The tracked systems are matched to overpasses of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, and a composite picture of the evolution of various radar and lightning characteristics is built up. The results suggest a fundamental difference in the convective life cycle between land and ocean. African storms evolve from convectively active systems with frequent lightning in their developing stages to more stratiform conditions as they dissipate. Over the Atlantic, the convective fraction remains essentially constant into the dissipating stages, and lightning occurrence peaks late in the life cycle. This behavior is consistent with differences in convective sustainability in land and ocean regions as proposed in previous studies. The area expansion rate during the developing stages of convection is used to provide an estimate of the intensity of convection. Reasonable correlations are found between this index and the convective system lifetime, size, and depth.},

  abstract = {Abstract A clustering algorithm is used to define the radiative, hydrological, and microphysical properties of precipitating convective events in the equatorial region observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Storms are separated by surface type, size, and updraft strength, the latter defined by the presence or absence of lightning. SST data and global reanalysis products are used to explore sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions. Small storms are much more numerous than mesoscale convective systems, and account for fairly little of the total rainfall but contribute significantly to reflection of sunlight. Lightning storms rain more heavily, have greater cloud area, extend to higher altitude, and have higher albedos than storms without lightning. Lightning is favored by a steep lower-troposphere lapse rate and moist midlevel humidity. Storms occur more often at SST {$\geq$} 28\textdegree C and with strong upward 500-mb mean vertical velocity. In general, storms over warmer ocean waters rain more heavily, are larger, and have higher cloud tops, but they do not have noticeably higher albedos than storms over cooler ocean waters. Mesoscale convective system properties are more sensitive to SST. Rain rates and cloud-top heights increase statistically significantly with mean upward motion. Rain rates increase with albedo and cloud-top height over ocean, but over land there are also storms with cloud-top temperatures {$>-$}35\textdegree C whose rain rates decrease with increasing albedo. Both the fraction of available moisture that rains out and the fraction that detrains as ice increase with SST, the former faster than the latter. TRMM ice water paths derived from cloud-resolving models but constrained by observed microwave radiances are only weakly correlated with observed albedo. The results are inconsistent with the ``adaptive iris'' hypothesis and suggest feedbacks due primarily to increasing convective cloud cover with warming, but more weakly than predicted by the ``thermostat'' hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The effect of cloud-radiation interactions on cloud properties is examined in the context of a limited-domain cloud-resolving model. The atmospheric cloud radiative effect (ACRE) influences the areal extent of tropical high clouds in two distinct ways. The first is through direct radiative destabilization of the elevated cloud layers, mostly as a result of longwave radiation heating the cloud bottom and cooling the cloud top. The second effect is radiative stabilization, whereby cloud radiative heating of the atmospheric column stabilizes the atmosphere to deep convection. In limited area domain simulations, the stabilizing (or indirect) effect is the dominant role of the cloud radiative heating, thus reducing the cloud cover in simulations where ACRE is included compared to those where it is removed. Direct cloud radiative heating increases high cloud fraction, decreases mean cloud optical depth, and increases cloud top temperature. The indirect cloud radiative heating decreases high cloud fraction, but also decreases mean cloud optical depth and increases cloud top temperature. The combination of these effects increases the top-of-atmosphere cloud radiative effect. In mock-Walker circulation experiments, the decrease in high cloud amount owing to radiative stabilization tends to cancel out the increase in high cloud amount owing to the destabilization within the cloud layer. The changes in cloud optical depth and cloud top pressure, however, are similar to those produced in the limited area domain simulations.},

Multiple linear regression is used to relate the radiation budget data to the cloud data. Comparing cloud forcing estimates obtained from the ISCCP-ERBE regression with those derived from the ERBE scene identification shows generally good agreement except over snow, in tropical convective regions, and in regions that are either nearly cloudless or always overcast. It is suggested that a substantial fraction of the disagreement in longwave cloud forcing in tropical convective regions is associated with the fact that the ERBE scene identification does not take into account variations in upper-tropospheric water vapor. On a global average basis, low clouds make the largest contribution to the net energy balance of the earth, because they cover such a large area and because their albedo effect dominates their effect on emitted thermal radiation. High, optically thick clouds can also very effectively reduce the energy balance, however, because their very high albedos overcome their low emission temperatures.},

This rapid decline of clear-sky longwave cooling occurs because radiative emission from water vapor becomes inefficient above 200 hPa. The emission from water vapor becomes less important than the emission from CO2 because the saturation vapor pressure is so very low at the temperatures above 200 hPa. This suggests that the temperature at the detrainment level, and consequently the emission temperature of tropical anvil clouds, will remain constant during climate change. This constraint has very important implications for the potential role of tropical convective clouds in climate feedback, since it means that the emission temperatures of tropical anvil clouds and upper tropospheric water vapor are essentially independent of the surface temperature, so long as the tropopause is colder than the temperature where emission from water vapor becomes relatively small.},

The software has been designed to be used flexibly with any two- or three-dimensional time-varying input. The application of high-level data formats, such as {$<$}code{$>$}Iris{$<$}/code{$>$} cubes or {$<$}code{$>$}xarray{$<$}/code{$>$} arrays, for input and output allows for convenient use of metadata in the tracking analysis and visualisation. Comprehensive analysis routines are provided to derive properties like cloud lifetimes or statistics of cloud properties along with tools to visualise the results in a convenient way. The application of tobac is presented in two examples. We first track and analyse scattered deep convective cells based on maximum vertical velocity and the three-dimensional condensate mixing ratio field in cloud-resolving model simulations. We also investigate the performance of the tracking algorithm for different choices of time resolution of the model output. In the second application, we show how the framework can be used to effectively combine information from two different types of datasets by simultaneously tracking convective clouds in model simulations and in geostationary satellite images based on outgoing longwave radiation. The tobac framework provides a flexible new way to include the evolution of the characteristics of individual clouds in a range of important analyses like model intercomparison studies or model assessment based on observational data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV. The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the large-scale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating.},

It takes contiguous CloudSat cloudy regions and identifies various length scales of clouds from a tropical, oceanic subset of data. The methodology identifies a level above which anvil characteristics become important by analyzing the cloud object shape. Below this level in what is termed the pedestal region, convective cores are identified based on reflectivity maxima. Identifying these regions allows for the assessment of length scales of the anvil and pedestal of deep convective clouds. Cloud objects are also appended with certain environmental quantities from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Simple geospatial and temporal assessments show that the cloud object technique agrees with standard observations of local frequency of deep convective cloudiness. Deep convective clouds over tropical oceans play important roles in Earth's climate system. The newly developed data set is used to evaluate the response of tropical, deep convective clouds to sea surface temperature (SST). Several previously proposed responses are examined: the Fixed Anvil Temperature Hypothesis, the Iris Hypothesis, and the Thermostat Hypothesis. When the data are analyzed per cloud object, increasing SST is found to be associated with increased anvil thickness, decreased anvil width, and cooler cloud top temperatures. Implications for the corresponding hypotheses are discussed. A new response suggesting that the base temperature of deep convective anvils remains approximately constant with increasing SSTs is introduced. These cloud dependencies on SST are integrated to form a more comprehensive theory for deep convective anvil responses to SST.},

In this study, the ERBS decadal observations are compared with the predictions of the Iris hypothesis using 3.5-box model. To further understand the predictions, the tropical radiative properties observed from recent Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiation budget experiment [the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) parameters] are used to replace the modeled values in the Iris hypothesis. The predicted variations of the radiation fields strongly depend on the relationship (-22\% K-1) of tropical high cloud and sea surface temperature (SST) assumed by the Iris hypothesis. On the decadal time scale, the predicted tropical mean radiative flux anomalies are generally significantly different from those of the ERBS measurements, suggesting that the decadal ERBS nonscanner radiative energy budget measurements do not support the strong negative feedback of the Iris effect. Poor agreements between the satellite data and model predictions even when the tropical radiative properties from CERES observations (LaRC parameters) are used imply that besides the Iris-modeled tropical radiative properties, the unrealistic variations of tropical high cloud generated from the detrainment of deep convection with SST assumed by the Iris hypothesis are likely to be another major factor for causing the deviation between the predictions and observations.},

Most current studies of atmospheric climate feedbacks have focused on such quantities as clear sky humidity, average humidity, or differences between regions of high and low humidity, but the data suggest that another possible feedback might consist of changes in the relative areas of high and low humidity and cloudiness. Motivated by the observed relation between cloudiness (above the trade wind boundary layer) and high humidity, cloud data for the eastern part of the western Pacific from the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (which provides high spatial and temporal resolution) have been analyzed, and it has been found that the area of cirrus cloud coverage normalized by a measure of the area of cumulus coverage decreases about 22\% per degree Celsius increase in the surface temperature of the cloudy region. A number of possible interpretations of this result are examined and a plausible one is found to be that cirrus detrainment from cumulus convection diminishes with increasing temperature. The implications of such an effect for climate are examined using a simple two-dimensional radiative\textendash convective model. The calculations show that such a change in the Tropics could lead to a negative feedback in the global climate, with a feedback factor of about -1.1, which if correct, would more than cancel all the positive feedbacks in the more sensitive current climate models. Even if regions of high humidity were not coupled to cloudiness, the feedback factor due to the clouds alone would still amount to about -0.45, which would cancel model water vapor feedback in almost all models. This new mechanism would, in effect, constitute an adaptive infrared iris that opens and closes in order to control the Outgoing Longwave Radiation in response to changes in surface temperature in a manner similar to the way in which an eye's iris opens and closes in response to changing light levels. Not surprisingly, for upper-level clouds, their infrared effect dominates their shortwave effect. Preliminary attempts to replicate observations with GCMs suggest that models lack such a negative cloud/moist areal feedback.},

EBAF Ed4.0 is an update to EBAF Ed2.8, incorporating all of the Ed4.0 suite of CERES data product algorithm improvements and consistent input datasets throughout the record. A one-time adjustment to shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) TOA fluxes is made to ensure that global mean net TOA flux for July 2005\textendash June 2015 is consistent with the in situ value of 0.71 W m-2. While global mean all-sky TOA flux differences between Ed4.0 and Ed2.8 are within 0.5 W m-2, appreciable SW regional differences occur over marine stratocumulus and snow/sea ice regions. Marked regional differences in SW clear-sky TOA flux occur in polar regions and dust areas over ocean. Clear-sky LW TOA fluxes in EBAF Ed4.0 exceed Ed2.8 in regions of persistent high cloud cover. Owing to substantial differences in global mean clear-sky TOA fluxes, the net cloud radiative effect in EBAF Ed4.0 is -18 W m-2 compared to -21 W m-2 in EBAF Ed2.8. The overall uncertainty in 1\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 1\textdegree{} latitude\textendash longitude regional monthly all-sky TOA flux is estimated to be 3 W m-2 [one standard deviation (1{$\sigma$})] for the Terra-only period and 2.5 W m-2 for the Terra\textendash Aqua period both for SW and LW fluxes. The SW clear-sky regional monthly flux uncertainty is estimated to be 6 W m-2 for the Terra-only period and 5 W m-2 for the Terra\textendash Aqua period. The LW clear-sky regional monthly flux uncertainty is 5 W m-2 for Terra only and 4.5 W m-2 for Terra\textendash Aqua.},

The Community Cloud retrieval for Climate~(CC4CL) is a cloud property retrieval system for satellite-based multispectral imagers and is an important component of the Cloud Climate Change Initiative~(Cloud\_cci) project. In this paper we discuss the optimal estimation retrieval of cloud optical thickness, effective radius and cloud top pressure based on the Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud~(ORAC) algorithm. Key to this method is the forward model, which includes the clear-sky model, the liquid water and ice cloud models, the surface model including a bidirectional reflectance distribution function~(BRDF), and the "fast" radiative transfer solution (which includes a multiple scattering treatment). All of these components and their assumptions and limitations will be discussed in detail. The forward model provides the accuracy appropriate for our retrieval method. The errors are comparable to the instrument noise for cloud optical thicknesses greater than 10. At optical thicknesses less than 10 modeling errors become more significant. The retrieval method is then presented describing optimal estimation in general, the nonlinear inversion method employed, measurement and a priori inputs, the propagation of input uncertainties and the calculation of subsidiary quantities that are derived from the retrieval results. An evaluation of the retrieval was performed using measurements simulated with noise levels appropriate for the MODIS instrument. Results show errors less than 10\,\% for cloud optical thicknesses greater than 10. Results for clouds of optical thicknesses less than 10 have errors up to 20\,\%.},

  abstract = {This study presents a novel approach for the early detection of developing thunderstorms. To date, methods for the detection of developing thunderstorms have usually relied on accurate Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) for the estimation of the cooling rates of convective clouds, which correspond to the updraft strengths of the cloud objects. In this study, we present a method for the estimation of the updraft strength that does not rely on AMVs. The updraft strength is derived directly from the satellite observations in the SEVIRI water vapor channels. For this purpose, the absolute value of the vector product of spatio-temporal gradients of the SEVIRI water vapor channels is calculated for each satellite pixel, referred to as Normalized Updraft Strength (NUS). The main idea of the concept is that vertical updraft leads to NUS values significantly above zero, whereas horizontal cloud movement leads to NUS values close to zero. Thus, NUS is a measure of the strength of the vertical updraft and can be applied to distinguish between advection and convection. The performance of the method has been investigated for two summer periods in 2016 and 2017 by validation with lightning data. Values of the Critical Success Index (CSI) of about 66\% for 2016 and 60\% for 2017 demonstrate the good performance of the method. The Probability of Detection (POD) values for the base case are 81.8\% for 2016 and 89.2\% for 2017, respectively. The corresponding False Alarm Ratio (FAR) values are 22.6\% (2016) and 36.4\% (2017), respectively. In summary, the method has the potential to reduce forecast lead time significantly and can be quite useful in regions without a well-maintained radar network.},

The study investigates the role of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) filtering for the remote sensing of Cumulonimbus Clouds (Cbs) by implementation of about 30 different experiments, covering Central Europe. These experiments compile different stability filter settings as well as the use of different channels for the InfraRed (IR) brightness temperatures (BT). As stability filters, parameters from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are used. The application of the stability filters restricts the detection of Cbs to regions with a labile atmosphere. Various NWP filter settings are investigated in the experiments. The brightness temperature information results from the infrared (IR) Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Image (SEVIRI) instrument on-board of the Meteosat Second Generation satellite and enables the detection of very cold and high clouds close to the tropopause. Various satellite channels and BT thresholds are applied in the different experiments. The satellite only approaches (no NWP filtering) result in the detection of Cbs with a relative high probability of detection, but unfortunately combined with a large False Alarm Rate (FAR), leading to a Critical Success Index (CSI) below 60\% for the investigated summer period in 2016. The false alarms result from other types of very cold and high clouds. It is shown that the false alarms can be significantly decreased by application of an appropriate NWP stability filter, leading to the increase of CSI to about 70\% for 2016. CSI is increased from about 70 to about 75\% by application of NWP filtering for the other investigated summer period in 2017. A brief review and reflection of the literature clarify that the function of the NWP filter can not be replaced by MSG IR spectroscopy. Thus, NWP filtering is strongly recommended to increase the quality of satellite based Cb detection. Further, it has been shown that the well established convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the convection index (KO) work well as a stability filter.},

The ITCZ paradigm stems from a time when tropical rainfall was assumed to be associated mainly with localized convection. Its development was also linked to the emergence of midlatitude frontal concepts. The paradigm has numerous shortcomings, including the diversity of definitions and the large number of parameters used to identify the ITCZ. A historical look at the concept shows that its use over Africa has long been controversial, with many eminent tropical meteorologists harshly criticizing its applicability over this continent. However, the seasonal excursion of the ITCZ remains the classical explanation for African rainy seasons, especially in the equatorial region. This article underscores the shortcomings of the paradigm in equatorial Africa by examining various aspects of the circulation associated with the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall during the equatorial rainy seasons. The overall conclusion is that a deeper understanding of the seasonal cycle in the equatorial regions of Africa still needs to be developed.},

  abstract = {This article presents an overview of the land ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone) over West Africa, based on analysis of NCAR\textendash NCEP Reanalysis data. The picture that emerges is much different than the classic one. The most important feature is that the ITCZ is effectively independent of the system that produces most of the rainfall. Rainfall linked directly to this zone of surface convergence generally affects only the southern Sahara and the northern-most Sahel, and only in abnormally wet years in the region. A second feature is that the rainbelt normally assumed to represent the ITCZ is instead produced by a large core of ascent lying between the African Easterly Jet and the Tropical Easterly Jet. This region corresponds to the southern track of African Easterly Waves, which distribute the rainfall. This finding underscores the need to distinguish between the ITCZ and the feature better termed the ``tropical rainbelt''. The latter is conventionally but improperly used in remote sensing studies to denote the surface ITCZ over West Africa. The new picture also suggests that the moisture available for convection is strongly coupled to the strength of the uplift, which in turn is controlled by the characteristics of the African Easterly Jet and Tropical Easterly Jet, rather than by moisture convergence. This new picture also includes a circulation feature not generally considered in most analyses of the region. This feature, a low-level westerly jet termed the African Westerly Jet, plays a significant role in interannual and multidecadal variability in the Sahel region of West Africa. Included are discussions of the how this new view relates to other aspects of West Africa meteorology, such as moisture sources, rainfall production and forecasting, desertification, climate monitoring, hurricanes and interannual variability. The West African monsoon is also related to a new paradigm for examining the interannual variability of rainfall over West Africa, one that relates changes in annual rainfall to changes in either the intensity of the rainbelt or north\textendash south displacements of this feature. The new view presented here is consistent with a plethora of research on the synoptic and dynamic aspects of the African Easterly Waves, the disturbances that are linked to rainfall over West Africa and spawn hurricanes over the Atlantic, and with our knowledge of the prevailing synoptic and dynamic features. This article demonstrate a new aspect of the West Africa monsoon, a bimodal state, with one mode linked to dry conditions in the Sahel and the other linked to wet conditions. The switch between modes appears to be linked to an inertial instability mechanism, with the cross-equatorial pressure gradient being a critical factor. The biomodal state has been shown for the month of August only, but this month contributes most of the interannual variability. This new picture of the monsoon and interannual variability shown here appears to be relevant not only to interannual variability, but also to the multidecadal variability evidenced in the region between the 1950s and 1980s.},

We show that over land the timing of the daily cycle of convection relative to the daily cycle in solar illumination and surface temperature significantly affects the mean radiative forcing by DCCs. Displacement of the daily cycle of DCC coverage by 2 hours changes their overall radiative effect by {$\sim$}10 W m-2, with implications for the simulation of the radiative balance in this region. The timing of the minimum DCC cover over land, close to noon local time, means that the mean radiative forcing is nearly maximized.},

TAMS combines area-overlapping and projected-cloud-edge tracking techniques to maximize the probability of detecting the progression of a convective system through time, accounting for splits and mergers. The combination of projection on area overlapping is equivalent to setting the background flow in which MCSs are moving on. Sensitivity tests show that area-overlapping technique with no projection (thus, no background flow) underestimates the real propagation speed of MCSs over Africa. The MCS life cycles and propagation derived using TAMS are consistent with climatology. The rainfall assignment is also more reliable than with previous methods as it utilizes a combination of regridding through linear interpolation with high temporal and spatial resolution data. This makes possible the identification of extreme rainfall events associated with intense MCSs more effectively. TAMS will be utilized in future work to build an AEW\textendash MCS dataset to study tropical cyclogenesis.},

Quantitative estimates of the global distributions of cloud-radiative forcing have been obtained from the spaceborne Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) launched in 1984. For the April 1985 period, the global shortwave cloud forcing [-44.5 watts per square meter (W/m2)] due to the enhancement of planetary albedo, exceeded in magnitude the longwave cloud forcing (31.3 W/m2) resulting from the greenhouse effect of clouds. Thus, clouds had a net cooling effect on the earth. This cooling effect is large over the mid- and high-latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 W/m2. The monthly averaged longwave cloud forcing reached maximum values of 50 to 100 W/m2 over the convectively disturbed regions of the tropics. However, this heating effect is nearly canceled by a correspondingly large negative shortwave cloud forcing, which indicates the delicately balanced state of the tropics. The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling. Hence, small changes in the cloud-radiative forcing fields can play a significant role as a climate feedback mechanism. For example, during past glaciations a migration toward the equator of the field of strong, negative cloud-radiative forcing, in response to a similar migration of cooler waters, could have significantly amplified oceanic cooling and continental glaciation.}

While convective storms formed above horizontal rolls in the absence of any additional surface forcing, the most intense storms initiated in regions above: gust fronts, gust front interaction with horizontal rolls, and terrain-induced stationary convergence zones. The onset of vigorous cloud growth leading to storm development was characterized by cloud tops that reached subfreezing temperatures and exhibited large cooling rates at cloud top 15 min prior to the first detection of 10-dBZ radar echoes aloft and 30 min before 35 dBZ. The rate of cloud-top temperature change was found to be important for discriminating between weakly precipitating storms ({$<$}35 dBZ) and vigorous convective storms ({$>$}35 dBZ). Results from this study have been used to increase the lead time of thunderstorm initiation nowcasts with the NCAR automated, convective storm nowcasting system. This improvement is demonstrated at two operational forecast offices in Virginia and New Mexico.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are important to the water and energy budget of the tropical climate and are essential ingredients of the tropical circulation. MCSs are readily observed in satellite infrared geostationary imagery as cloud clusters that evolve in time from small structures to well-organized large patches of cloud shield before dissipating. The MCS cloud shield is the result of a large ensemble of mesoscale dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical processes. This study shows that a simple parametric model can summarize the time evolution of the morphological characteristics of the cloud shield during the life cycle of the MCS. It consists of a growth\textendash decay linear model of the cloud shield and is based on three parameters: the time of maximum extent, the maximum extent, and the duration of the MCS. It is shown that the time of maximum is frequently close to the middle of the life cycle and that the correlation between maximum extent and duration is strong all over the tropics. This suggests that 1 degree of freedom is left to summarize the life cycle of the MCS cloud shield. Such a model fits the observed MCS equally well, independent of the duration, size, location, and propagation characteristics, and its relevance is assessed for a large number of MCSs over three boreal summer periods over the whole tropical belt. The scaling of this simple model exhibits weak (strong) regional variability for the short- (long-) lived systems indicative of the primary importance of the internal dynamics of the systems to the large-scale environment for MCS sustainability.},

  abstract = {The Fixed Anvil Temperature (FAT) hypothesis proposes that upper tropospheric cloud fraction peaks at a special isotherm that is independent of surface temperature. It has been argued that a FAT should result from simple ingredients: Clausius-Clapeyron, longwave emission from water vapor, and tropospheric energy and mass balance. Here the first cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium designed to contain only these basic ingredients are presented. This setup does not produce a FAT: the anvil temperature varies by about 40\% of the surface temperature range. However, the tropopause temperature varies by only 4\% of the surface temperature range, which supports the existence of a Fixed Tropopause Temperature (FiTT). In full-complexity radiative-convective equilibrium simulations, the spread in anvil temperature is smaller by about a factor of 2, but the tropopause temperature remains more invariant than the anvil temperature by an order of magnitude. In other words, our simulations have a FiTT, not a FAT.},

We use combined radar-lidar observations and a radiative transfer model to investigate the influence of radiative heating on anvil cloud altitude, thickness, and microphysical structure. We find that high clouds with an optical depth between 1 and 2 are prevalent in tropical convective regions and can persist far from any convective source. These clouds are generally located at higher altitudes than optically thicker clouds, experience strong radiative heating, and contain high concentrations of ice crystals indicative of turbulence. These findings support the hypothesis that anvil clouds are driven toward and maintained at a preferred optical thickness that corresponds to a positive cloud radiative effect. Comparison of daytime and nighttime observations suggests that anvil thinning proceeds more rapidly at night, when net radiative cooling promotes the sinking of cloud top. It is hypothesized that the properties of aged anvil clouds and their susceptibility to radiative destabilization are shaped by the time of day at which the cloud was detrained. These results underscore the importance of small-scale processes in determining the radiative effect of tropical convection.},

These two missions have provided a 10-yr demonstration of coordinated formation flying that made it possible to develop integrated products and that offered new insights into key atmospheric processes. The progress achieved over this decade of observations, summarized in this paper, clearly demonstrate the fundamental importance of the vertical structure of clouds and aerosol for understanding the influences of the larger-scale atmospheric circulation on aerosol, the hydrological cycle, the cloud-scale physics, and the formation of the major storm systems of Earth. The research also underscored inherent ambiguities in radiance data in describing cloud properties and how these active systems have greatly enhanced passive observation. It is now clear that monitoring the vertical structure of clouds and aerosol is essential, and a climate data record is now being constructed. These pioneering efforts are to be continued with the Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission planned for launch in 2019.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines a radiation parameterization method for deriving broadband fluxes that is currently being implemented in a number of global and regional atmospheric models. The rationale for the use of the 2-stream method as a way of solving the radiative transfer problem for broadband solar and longwave fluxes is presented. This rationale is based on assessment of these models in the context of a novel method of classifying radiative transfer problems that more clearly identifies the types of problems encountered in calculating globally distributed broadband fluxes. The delta-Eddington model (DEM) and the constant-hemispheric 2-stream models (CHMs) are shown to be superior to other 2-stream methods of solution under this classification and also superior to 4-stream solutions for the many classes of problems relevant to modeling the global atmosphere. These two methods are used to construct a radiation model of broadband solar and IR fluxes based on the k-distribution data of Fu and Liou. When tested against available line-by-line (LBL) and other reference model calculations of broadband fluxes, it is shown that (i) comparisons of CHM top-of-atmosphere (TOA) clear-sky longwave fluxes with fluxes obtained from LBL models agree within approximately 1\textendash 2 W m-2. The agreement with LBL clear-sky fluxes at the surface, typically within 5 W m-2, is compromised by the specific form of continuum absorption parameterization adopted. (ii) The clear- and cloudy-sky solar fluxes and heating rates agree remarkably with a reference doubling\textendash adding multiple scattering model. The rms TOA flux difference under all-sky conditions is approximately 6 W m-2; the layer-mean heating rate difference is 0.1 K day-1. (iii) The effect of IR scattering by clouds is shown to produce a bias when neglected that generally exceeds the model-to-model differences presented. Neglect of IR scattering produces a global bias in the calculated outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) of approximately -8 W m-2 (i.e., the nonscattering models calculated an OLR that is larger than what the scattering models calculated by this amount). Locally, the TOA bias may approach 20 W m-2. The associated bias in surface longwave fluxes varies in magnitude between 2 and 5 W m-2. It was also shown how the computational effort required to produce broadband fluxes varies linearly with the number of model layers. This is an important characteristic given the increasing tendency for increasing the vertical resolution of atmospheric models.},

  abstract = {Increasing global precipitation has been associated with a warming climate resulting from a strengthening of the hydrological cycle1. This increase, however, is not spatially uniform. Observations and models have found that changes in rainfall show patterns characterized as `wet-gets-wetter'1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and `warmer-gets-wetter'5,8,9. These changes in precipitation are largely located in the tropics and hence are probably associated with convection. However, the underlying physical processes for the observed changes are not entirely clear. Here we show from observations that most of the regional increase in tropical precipitation is associated with changes in the frequency of organized deep convection. By assessing the contributions of various convective regimes to precipitation, we find that the spatial patterns of change in the frequency of organized deep convection are strongly correlated with observed change in rainfall, both positive and negative (correlation of 0.69), and can explain most of the patterns of increase in rainfall. In contrast, changes in less organized forms of deep convection or changes in precipitation within organized deep convection contribute less to changes in precipitation. Our results identify organized deep convection as the link between changes in rainfall and in the dynamics of the tropical atmosphere, thus providing a framework for obtaining a better understanding of changes in rainfall. Given the lack of a distinction between the different degrees of organization of convection in climate models10, our results highlight an area of priority for future climate model development in order to achieve accurate rainfall projections in a warming climate.},

Datasets from geostationary satellite instruments such as the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) provide high-time-resolution observations across a large area. In this study we use data from SEVIRI to quantify the diurnal cycle of cloud top temperature within the instrument's field of view and discuss these results in relation to retrieval biases. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} We evaluate SEVIRI cloud top temperatures from the new CLAAS-2 (CLoud property dAtAset using SEVIRI, Edition 2) dataset against Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data. Results show a mean bias of +0.44K with a standard deviation of 11.7K, which is in agreement with previous validation studies. Analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of these errors shows that absolute retrieval biases vary from less than 5K over the southeast Atlantic Ocean up to 30K over central Africa at night. Night- and daytime retrieval biases can also differ by up to 30K in some areas, potentially contributing to biases in the estimated amplitude of the diurnal cycle. This illustrates the importance of considering spatial and diurnal variations in retrieval errors when using the CLAAS-2 dataset. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Keeping these biases in mind, we quantify the seasonal, diurnal, and spatial variation of cloud top temperature across SEVIRI's field of view using the CLAAS-2 dataset. By comparing the mean diurnal cycle of cloud top temperature with the retrieval bias, we find that diurnal variations in the retrieval bias can be small but are often of the same order of magnitude as the amplitude of the observed diurnal cycle, indicating that in some regions the diurnal cycle apparent in the observations may be significantly impacted by diurnal variability in the accuracy of the retrieval. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} We show that the CLAAS-2 dataset can measure the diurnal cycle of cloud tops accurately in regions of stratiform cloud such as the southeast Atlantic Ocean and Europe, where cloud top temperature retrieval biases are small and exhibit limited spatial and temporal variability. Quantifying the diurnal cycle over the tropics and regions of desert is more difficult, as retrieval biases are larger and display significant diurnal variability. CLAAS-2 cloud top temperature data are found to be of limited skill in measuring the diurnal cycle accurately over desert regions. In tropical regions such as central Africa, the diurnal cycle can be described by the CLAAS-2 data to some extent, although retrieval biases appear to reduce the amplitude of the real diurnal cycle of cloud top temperatures. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This is the first study to relate the diurnal variations in SEVIRI retrieval bias to observed diurnal cycles in cloud top temperature.

This investigation focuses on two regions, the western Bod\'el\'e of Chad and eastern Burkina Faso, that have a propensity for daytime rainfall, but why this occurs does not conform to our conventional understanding of being directly associated with the presence of significant topographic feature(s). The August diurnal cycle of rainfall for the Bod\'el\'e is characterized by an afternoon peak, with mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) originating within 500~km accounting for 80\% of the afternoon precipitation. These MCSs are associated with a deepening of the monsoon trough over the western Sahara related to northern storm track African easterly wave (AEW) disturbance activity, combined with anomalous ridging over eastern Chad associated with cold pool outflow from convection that originates over the Marra Mountains the previous afternoon. These circulation features enhance the moist low-level southwesterly flow and increase instability over the Bod\'el\'e. Over Burkina Faso rainfall has a primary afternoon peak, and a secondary morning peak. MCSs account for 95\% of the total rainfall. Morning rainfall is primarily due to MCSs forming over the Damergou Gap of Niger, while the afternoon rainfall is associated with MCSs that originate over the Damergou Gap as well as locally. While both types of MCSs are associated with an approaching southern storm track AEW disturbance, it is differences in northern storm track activity that helps explain why some MCSs originate over the Damergou Gap.},

The coverage of deep-convective clouds increases with stronger upward motion, but the proportion of thick, medium, and thin anvil cloud remains nearly constant. Thus, when averaging over scales larger than individual storms, the top-of-atmosphere net radiation is only weakly sensitive to the large-scale flow. The balance in cloud radiative effects is therefore maintained across a wide range of large-scale circulations. The ability of the Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 to reproduce the observed cloud-circulation relationships is investigated. The simulated convective clouds substantially overestimate the proportion of deep and optically thick cloud and underestimate the proportion of anvil cirrus. These results demonstrate that simulating key properties of deep-convective clouds remains challenging for some state-of-the-art climate models.},

  abstract = {Longwave cloud feedback is systematically positive and nearly the same magnitude across all global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Here it is shown that this robust positive longwave cloud feedback is caused in large part by the tendency for tropical high clouds to rise in such a way as to remain at nearly the same temperature as the climate warms. Furthermore, it is shown that such a cloud response to a warming climate is consistent with well-known physics, specifically the requirement that, in equilibrium, tropospheric heating by convection can only be large in the altitude range where radiative cooling is efficient, following the fixed anvil temperature hypothesis of Hartmann and Larson (2002). Longwave cloud feedback computed assuming that high-cloud temperature follows upper tropospheric convergence-weighted temperature, which we refer to as proportionately higher anvil temperature, gives an excellent prediction of the longwave cloud feedback in the AR4 models. The ensemble-mean feedback of 0.5 W m-2 K-1 is much larger than that calculated assuming clouds remain at fixed pressure, highlighting the large contribution from rising cloud tops to the robustly positive feedback. An important result of this study is that the convergence profile computed from clear-sky energy and mass balance warms slightly as the climate warms, in proportion to the increase in stability, which results in a longwave cloud feedback that is slightly smaller than that calculated assuming clouds remain at fixed temperature.},

  abstract = {SummaryCb-TRAM is a new fully automated tracking and nowcasting algorithm. Intense convective cells are detected, tracked and discriminated with respect to onset, rapid development, and mature phase. The detection is based on Meteosat-8 SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager) data from the broad band high resolution visible, infra-red 6.2 \textmu m (water vapour), and the infra-red 10.8 \textmu m channels. In addition, tropopause temperature data from ECMWF operational model analyses is utilised as an adaptive detection criterion. The tracking is based on geographical overlap between current detections and first guess patterns of cells predicted from preceeding time steps. The first guess patterns as well as short range forecast extrapolations are obtained with the aid of a new image matching algorithm providing complete fields of approximate differential cloud motion. Based on these motion vector fields interpolation and extrapolation of satellite data are obtained which allow to generate synthetic intermediate data fields between two known fields as well as nowcasts of motion and development of detected areas. Examples of the application of Cb-TRAM and a comparison to precipitation radar and lightning data as independent data sources demonstrate the capabilities of the new technique.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In this paper, recent changes to the Meteosat thunderstorm TRacking And Monitoring algorithm (Cb-TRAM) are presented as well as a validation of Cb-TRAM against data from the European ground-based LIghtning NETwork (LINET) of Nowcast GmbH and the South African Weather Service Lightning Detection Network (SAWS LDN). Validation is conducted along the well-known skill measures probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR) on the basis of Meteosat/SEVIRI pixels as well as on the basis of thunderstorm objects. The values obtained demonstrate specific limitations of Cb-TRAM, as well as limitations of satellite methods in general which are based on thermal emission and solar reflectivity information from thunderstorm cloud tops. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Although the climatic conditions and the occurrence of thunderstorms are quite different for Europe and South Africa, quality score values are similar. Our conclusion is that Cb-TRAM provides robust results of well-defined quality for very different climatic regimes. The POD for a thunderstorm with intense lightning is about 80\% during the day. The FAR for a Cb-TRAM detection which is not even close to intense lightning is about 50\%. If only proximity to any lightning activity is required, FAR is much lower at about 15\%. Pixel-based analysis shows that detected thunderstorm object size is not indiscriminately large, but well within physical limitations of the satellite method. Night-time POD and FAR are somewhat worse as the detection scheme does not use the high-resolution visible information during night-time hours. Nowcasting scores show useful values up to approximately 30 min in advance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
